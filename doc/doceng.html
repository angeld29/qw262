<h2>QW262 by [2WP]BorisU revision 10</h2>
<h2>Major advances of QW262</h2>
<ul>
<li>TeamFortress anti-flash and anti-concussion cheats are disabled (old grens 
on). 
<li>GL version in TeamFortress now has the flash and gas grenade effects working 
in the same way as in software rendering.</li>
<li> GL version allows in-game gamma and contrast change.</li>
<li>A new algorithm of demo recording with delta_compression is implemented. Standard 
QW clients have delta_compression turned off by default while recording a demo 
and this usually results in undesired ping and PL increases. </li>
<li>A built-in support for some proxy functions like:<br>
<a href="#locfile">loc-files</a> of two types (qizmo and QW262 block format);<br>
<a href="#macros">message macros</a> (%l, %a, %h etc.). some of which are strongly 
improved. For example, one can transmit his map coordinates which means that anyone 
can interpret them acoording to his own loc-files.</li>
<li><a href="#filter">Advanced message filtering</a>;</li>
<li> Some fps-filter features.</li>
<li>Improved demo handling (easy browsing over all quake folders) and playback 
(including QWZ and MVD demos).</li>
<li>Improved console editing.</li>
<li>You can bind such buttons as capslock, numlock and all buttons of numeric 
pad separately.</li>
<li>Mice with 4 and more buttons are supported.</li>
<li>Configurable <a href="#hud">hud</a> allows to display a wide range of info 
during the gameplay (for example health, armor, ammo or value of any desired variable).</li>
<li>For even higher anti-cheating safety the ability to work on a <a
href="#qw262">rewritten protocol</a> is implemented. Using QW262 server in such 
a way makes it incompatible with other clients and proxies.</li>
</ul>
<p>Extra <a href="#common">features</a></p>
<ul>
<li>Improved <a
href="#script">script</a> handling. Naturally, it looks like a special QW262 macro 
language which includes: 
<ul>
<li>powerful variable processing (expansion, search and etc.) 
<li>improved work with aliases (increased speed, special features for complex 
aliases, aliases with parameters) 
<li>math feature - addition, substraction, multiplication and others 
<li>conditional execution of commands - <b>if/then/else</b> 
<li>improved logging 
</ul>
<li>Ability of automation of certain actions by means of triggers and <a href="#regexp">regexp-triggers</a>. 
This is apparently one of the most powerful tools for reacting to in-game events! 
At the moment on the basis of almost any message appearing on the screen one can 
provide execution of a certain alias. The application area is immense, but the 
minimal use is an advanced teammate communication system. 
</ul>
<a name=common></a> 
<h2>New settings and abilities</h2>
<p>The client is automatically responding the f_version queue sent by any player 
in messagemode 1. The answer is sent only one time in 20 seconds to avoid spamming.</p>
<p>If your config has a line containing <b>setinfo uid nick</b>, this nick becomes 
your id-name (any string up to 5 symbols will fit, case-sensitive). This is convenient 
if you have lots of nicks but still want your friends to recognize you. Uid can 
be viewed in userinfo and everybody using QW262 can do so using <b>users</b> command. 
Some commands in QW2.62 recognize and use uid in the same manner as id of a player. 
</p>
<p>The volume of a sound produced by <b>play</b> and <b>playvol</b> commands doesn't 
depend on a current distance from the place where thesecommands were issued. This 
is very handy for grenade-timers in TeamFortress.</p>
<p>While opening the console the view on the remaining part of the screen is corrected 
in the software version (works like in Unreal so that you don't miss any event 
when working in the console). Users of the GL version can adjust transparency 
of the console by a <b>gl_conalpha</b> variable (default is 0.8). At values about 
0.3 the console is transparent enough and there's no need for the view correction.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Client automatically determines if the server using jump-fix and tunes prediction 
accordingly.</p>

<h3> GL version specific.</h3>
<p>LIT-files are supported (static colored lighting). They are loaded from <b>maps</b> 
or <b>lits </b>directories. Works only if <b>gl_colorlights</b> cvar is set to 
1. </p>
<p>It is possible to use 24/32bit JPG, PNG, TGA and PCX (file search is performed 
in this order!) textures up to 2048x2048 size. When loading 'test' texture the 
client first look for test.link (link to other texture), then test.jpg, test.png, 
test.tga, test.pcx and finally for standard 8bit texture. If the name of the texture 
starts from '*' it is replaced by '#'. <i>Fullbright colors on 24/32bit textures 
are supported only if server permits it through '<b>serverinfo allow_24bit_fullbrights 
1</b>' - currently disabled.</i></p>
<p>It is possible to use 24/32bit textures for bsp-models, alias models, sprites, 
elements of quake interface (menu, statusbar), skyboxes and crosshairs. The following 
table summarizes the directories where textures shoul be placed:</p>
<table cellspacing=0 cellpadding=3 width="100%" border=0>
<tr> 
<td> bsp-models (walls, healthboxes etc.)</td>
<td><b>textures/mapname</b>, <b>textures/bmodels</b>,<b> textures</b></td>
</tr>
<tr> 
<td>alias-models (weapons, armor etc. except player.mdl!)</td>
<td><b>textures/models</b>, <b>textures/progs</b>,<b> textures</b></td>

<td>textures for quake interface</td>
<td><b>textures/gfx</b>, <b>textures/wad</b>, <b>gfx</b></td>
</tr>
<tr> 
<td>crosshairs</td>
<td><b>textures/crosshairs</b></td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>Console background can be loaded from <b>textures/gfx/conback.*</b> file. Console 
font can be loaded from <b>textures/charset.*</b>. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Some words abount .link file. This is a plaintext file containing the name 
of the texture (can contain path and must contain extention). For example if<b> 
some_texture.link</b> contain <b>TFcommon/blue_wall.tga</b> line, then loading 
<b>some_texture</b> will load <b>blue_wall.tga</b> from the indicated directory. 
This can eliminate texture duplication and allows meaningful naming of textures.</p>
<p>Skyboxes are supported. Name of skybox should be placed into <b>r_skybox</b> 
variable or you can use <b>loadsky skyboxname</b> command. Skybox textures have 
names <b>namexx.*</b> or <b>name_xx.*</b> (where xx: rt, bk, lf, ft, up, dn). 
Due to some problems with skybox rendering and possible cheating skybox should 
be allowed on server through '<b>serverinfo allow_skybox 1</b>'.</p>
<p>32bit texture can be used as crosshair (<b>crosshair 5</b>). Required rexture 
is loaded by <b>load_crosshair name</b> command. Partial transparency is supported. 
Size and color are set by <b>cl_crosssize</b> and <b>crosshaircolor</b> cvars<b>.</b></p>

Value 2 is the same as 0 with only difference that you can adjust <b>gamma</b> 
when playing. It is recommended that you use the value of 2 when playing GL under 
Win2000/WinXP.<br>
If you play with <b>vid_hwgammacontrol 0</b>, then you should use a <b>-gamma

<h3>Console logging</h3>
<p>It is now possible to switch on and off console logging at any desired moment

<table cellspacing=0 cellpadding=3 width="100%" border=0>
<tbody> 
<tr> 
<td valign=top><b>log_filename</b></td>
<td>if this variable is not empty, the logfile called @log_filename is put to

<tr> 
<td valign=top><b>log_prefix</b></td>
<td>this variableis is not empty, its content is inserted into the beginning of 
each logfile line. By the way, cvar expansion is allowed, and certainly all kind 
of log-processing programs (like SpeedStats) will go nuts but ... who cares? :)</td>
</tr>
<tr> 
<td valign=top><b>log_truncate</b></td>
<td>this command cuts a logfile size to 0; a name of logfile is defined by <b>log_filename</b> 
variable.</td>
</tr>
</tbody> 
</table>
<p>The log-file described would have absolutely no connection to that of -condebug 
key. Moreover, you can writw them both at once :)<br>
Examples:</p>
<p><b>// starts new log with timestamps<br>
log_prefix "[@date @time]"<br>
log_filename "mycoollog.txt"<br>
log_truncate </b></p>
<p><b>// stops logging<br>
log_filename ""</b></p>
<h3>Handling the number of packets sent to server</h3>
<p>The Quake engine is constructed in such a way that fps is rigidly connected 
to the number of packets sent to a server. This means that if you got a bad connection 
and a low <b>rate</b> number - you will hardly get nice fps. The <b>cl_c2spps</b> 
variable allows to limit the number of sent-to-server packets. At the same time 
your fps is defined by <b>cl_maxfps</b> variable. These &quot;extra&quot; packets 
are put away and the resulting backdrop is often packetloss and loss of some commands. 
Some solutions for keeping the most important information intact have been introduced 
but I would not promise heavens. </p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p><b>cl_maxfps 60<br>
cl_c2spps 30</b></p>
<h3>Changes in file searching algorithm</h3>
<p>It is possible to set gamedir at client sartup:</p>
<p><b>qwcl262 -game fortress</b></p>
<p>This put <b>fortress</b> directory to the list of directories where files are 
searched, so files situating there have a priority over files lying in <b>qw</b> 
and <b>id1</b>. This includes among others <b>quake.rc</b>, <b>autoexec.cfg</b>, 
<b>gfx.wad</b>, <b>conback.lmp</b> etc. </p>
<p>Small comment on <b>quake.rc</b>: Default <b>quake.rc</b> is included in <b>id1/pak0.pak</b> 
and contains execution of <b>autoexec.cfg</b>, <b>config.cfg</b> and <b>stuffcmds</b> 
command, that puts into execution buffer commands that were given in the command 
line (<b>+connect localhost</b> for example). If you have decided to write your 
own <b>quake.rc</b>, then you should make these action yourselves if it is required. 
When launced with <b>-game</b> paramerter and standard <b>quake.rc </b>client 
looks for <b>autoexec.cfg</b> file first in the given directory that allows automatiñ 
launching of the required mod config at startup, before connection to any server. 
</p>
<p>A <b>userdir</b> command can be used for addition of directories to the list 
searched for files by the client (configs, sounds, models, etc.). Real handy when 
several players with their own configs files play Quake on a single computer. 
</p>
<table cellspacing=0 cellpadding=3 width="100%" border=0>
<tbody> 
<tr> 
<td valign=top noWrap><b>userdir [dir [type]]</b></td>
<td> 
<p>adds a directory to the search list:<br>
0 (default) - &lt;quake_dir&gt;/&lt;gamedir&gt;/&lt;dir&gt;<br>

2 - &lt;quake_dir&gt;/qw/&lt;dir&gt;/&lt;gamedir&gt;<br>
3 - &lt;quake_dir&gt;/qw/&lt;dir&gt;<br>
4 - &lt;quake_dir&gt;/&lt;dir&gt;<br>
5 - $HOME/qw/&lt;dir&gt; (where $HOME is the contents of HOME enviroment variable)</p>
<p>When issuing this command after reconnection to a server or parameter is not 
defined, a current userdir is printed in the console.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody> 
</table>
<p>It is possible to set<b> userdir</b> at client startup. Then configs will be 
executed taking this directory into account. One can use <b>-userdir</b> and<b>-game</b> 
separately or both at once. Example:</p>
<p><b>qwcl262 -userdir vasya 2 -game fortress</b></p>
<p>It is possible to use PAK-files with arbitrary names. When the directory is 
added to the search path<b> </b>first files <b>pak0.pak, pak1.pak</b> are loaded, 
then <b>pak.lst</b> is read and all the PAK-files listed there are loaded (one 
per line with extension). GL-âåðñèÿ skips all files strting with <b>&quot;soft&quot;</b>, 
soft-version skips files starting with <b>&quot;gl&quot;</b>. If <b>userdir </b>is 
set to <b>name</b>, then finally <b>name.pak</b> is loaded. <br>
</p>
<h3>Demo recording and playing</h3>
<p>Demo-player is built into the client. You can reach it through <b>multiplayer-demos</b> 
menu or by the <b>menu_demos</b> command. It is possible to playback directly 
the qwd, qwz (qizmo compressed format) and mvd (multi view demos - server demos). 
The .qwz demos are automatically unpacked by qizmo. The unpacked file is deleted 
after the end of the playback. The <b>qizmo_dir</b> variable (&quot;qizmo&quot; 
by default) defines the folder in which qizmo surfs (according to quake dir). 
</p>
<p>Demo recording differs from that of qw2.30. In QW262 the delta-compression 
is not switched off and this feature reasonably decreases lags. You can now use 
<b>pause</b> command to pause while viewing a demo.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The beginning of a demo playback is detained till it's actually possible to 
show it. Helps when something interesting is in the very beginning and you MUST 
see it. </p>
<p>The playback of demos recorded in spectator mode with <b>cl_chasecam 1</b> 
is improved. The player's model is not shown now but you can see proper weapon 
model.</p>
<p>Other variables connected to demos:</p>
<table cellspacing=0 cellpadding=3 width="100%" border=0>
<tbody> 
<tr> 
<td valign=top><b>cl_demoflushtime</b></td>
<td> determines an interval of buffer flushing while recording a demo. By default 
is 5 (0 value returns the old behaviour). This is introduced to avoid too frequent 
disk write operations causing little lags and fps drop. </td>
</tr>
<tr> 
<td valign=top><b>cl_fovtodemo</b></td>
<td>when set to 1 (default), <b>fov</b> changes are recorded to your demo, which 
is especially nice for sniper-demos.</td>

<td valign=top><b>cl_demoplay_restrictions</b></td>
<td>when set to 0 (default 1), all buttons can be bound and hud is avaliable while 
watching a demo.</td>
</tr>
<tr> 
<td valign=top><b>cl_demoplay_flash</b> </td>
<td>decreases the effect of flash-grenade during demo playback (default 1). Value 
0.7 is well suited for watching demos of heavily flashed defenders :) </td>
</tr>
<tr> 
<td valign=top><b>cl_demoplayer_sort</b></td>
<td>determines files sorting in demo player. 0 - by name (default), 1 - by size. 
</td>
</tr>
</tbody> 
</table>
<h3>Spectator mode and MVD demos playback</h3>
<p>The spectator mode has been greatly improved. <b>mvd</b> demos playback is 
practically the same as spectating but you can set pause in any moment and switch 
to any player or move the cam. During camera switching effects of TeanFortress 
flash and concussion grenades are cleared.</p>
<table cellspacing=0 cellpadding=3 width="100%" border=0>
<tbody> 
<tr> 
<td valign=top><b>cl_spec_id</b></td>
<td>when set to 1 (default), a nick of a player you are looking at will be exposed; 
also pressing +attack will capture camera view on a player last running behind 
your crosshair.</td>
</tr>
<tr> 
<td><b>track (id | uid)</b></td>
<td>this commands switch camera view to a player with such an id/uid.</td>
</tr>
<tr> 
<td valign=top><b>cl_spectator_restrictions</b></td>
<td>when set to 0 (default 1), in spectator mode the hud and triggers are avaliable.</td>
</tr>
</tbody> 
</table>
<h3>Converting demos to AVI (filming)</h3>
<p>To faciliate this process there is a <b>capture </b>command. If you issue <b>capture 
&lt;fps&gt;</b> command during demo playback, the client starts to make a series 
of screenshots with the required fps. This mode is switched off by <b>capture 
0</b> command or automatically at demo end. There is <b>NO NEED</b> to worry if 
your computer is fast enough to write many screenshots. It is possible to write 
72 fps in 1600x1200 resolution.Of course it will be slow, but it is possible. 
And vice versa: if you need only 5 frames per second in 320x200 resolution, then 
it will be rather fast :) Screenshots are put into directory given by <b>capture_dir</b> 
variable (realtive to Quake directory, default: &quot;capture&quot;). Subdirectory 
is created with name <b>@date-@time</b> to prevent accidental overwriting of one 
series of screenshot by another.</p>
<h3>Mini-Gamespy</h3>
<p>One can get certain info about Quake servers without being connected to them.</p>
<table cellspacing=0 cellpadding=3 width="100%" border=0>
<tbody> 
<tr> 
<td valign=top noWrap><b>gamespy server:port</b></td>
<td>gives you info on a map name and a number of players sitting currently on 
the server.</td>
</tr>
<tr> 
<td><b>cl_gamespy_showplayers</b></td>
<td>if set to 1 (default is 0), <b>gamespy</b> also shows the players' information.</td>
</tr>
<tr> 
<td valign=top noWrap><b>cl_gamespy_showrules</b></td>
<td>when set to 1 (default is 0), <b>gamespy</b> shows serverinfo.</td>
</tr>
</tbody> 
</table>
<p>Example:<br>
<b>cl_gamespy_showplayers 1<br>
gamespy quake.orc.ru:27530</b></p>
<h3>Limitation of client capabilities using serverinfo fpd</h3>
<p>Client respects some limitations set by the server administration using serverinfo 
fpd and disable some functions. These bits in fpd are supported:</p>
<ul>
<li>1 - Macros in say are disabled</li>
<li>2 - Time variable won't show seconds</li>
<li>4 - Triggers are disabled</li>
</ul>
<p>During connect to server client reports in the consiole if something is disabled.</p>
<a name=filter></a> 
<h2>Message filtering</h2>
<p>There is a possibility to filter messages (works with any server but QW262 
server makes filtering at server-side thus reducing the network traffic). For 
a message to be filtered and reach you it must end with <b>#abc</b>, where abc 
is a name of the channel (must consist of 3 letters!). Messages without a name 
of a channel are never filtered off. It is possible to assign filtering via several 
channels. For example, <b>filter &quot;#att#eng&quot;</b> will allow you to obtain 
messages on <b>#att</b> and <b>#eng</b> channels. At the given moment widely used 
are only <b>#att</b> and <b>#def</b> channels for attack and defence modes respectively. 
When a <b>#def</b> filter is active you will not get messages marked differently 
than <b>#def</b>. In order to totally cancel filtering use a <b>filter &quot;&quot;</b> 
command. </p>
<h2>Improved console</h2>
<p>The following buttons and combinations work in the console::</p>
<table cellspacing=0 cellpadding=3 border=0 width="100%">
<tbody> 
<tr> 
<td valign=top>TAB</td>

</tbody> 
</table>
<p>-alias are blocked in console so that they do not executed when typing except 
for the keys that have no function in console (like Fx).</p>
<h2>Keyboard</h2>
<p>The number of bindable keys has been greatly expanded. It is now possible to 
bind CAPSLOCK, SCROLLCK, NUMLOCK, PRINTSCR. If a <b>cl_keypad</b> variable is 
set to 1, then you can bind the buttons of extended keyboard independently, i.e. 
the DEL and KP_DEL will make a difference. The names of buttons are listed below. 
Some buttons have several alternative names, so it is possible to use any of them.

<p>Notes:</p>
<p>In Win32 version PRINTSCR won't work if simultaneously CTRL, ALT etc buttons 
pressed.</p>
<h2>Mouse</h2>
<p> Mouse wheel works in DirectInput mode if <b>m_forcemwheel</b> cvar is set 
to 1.</p>
<p>MOUSE4 - MOUSE8 are supported. However driver support is required. It <i>works</i> 
with<i> </i>Microsoft drivers, <i>does not work</i> with Logitech Mouseware up 
to version 9.73. </p>
<p>Client has internal support for MOUSE4 - MOUSE8 buttons if Logitech Mouseware 
is installed (up to version 9.73) (mw_hook.dll library is required!). This mode 
is turned on by setting <b>m_mwhook</b> cvar to 1, and it does not matter what 
is mapped in to 4th-8th mouse button in Mouseware itself. If you don't like the 
default numbers of mouse buttons then you can change it using <b>m_map_button</b> 
command:</p>
<p>Example: logically swaps 4th and 5th mouse buttons, 6th button become an equivalent 
of keyboard key 'a' :<br>
<b>m_map_button 4 MOUSE5<br>
m_map_button 5 MOUSE4<br>
m_map_button 6 a</b></p>
<p></p>
<p> It as possible to use all keys emulated by Logitech Mouseware when mouse button 
is pressed (not only CTRL and SHIF). However one should know that:</p>
<ol>
<li><b>m_mwhook 1 </b>mode is more convinient.</li>
<li>Button up and down commands arrive without pause between them so you may need 
<b>wait</b>. </li>
<li>They arrive then the mouse button is RELEASED.</li>
<li>If you are using <b>cl_keypad 1</b> then KP_* variants of button are generated 
for PGDN, PGUP etc. </li>
</ol>

name=script></a> 
<h2>Advanced scripting</h2>
<p>Aliases execution speed was considerably elevated in comparison to QW2.30. 
The scripting language was widely extended. Command processing buffer was increased 
to 16K. A special alias <b>262_quakerc</b> is automatically executed on launching 
of the client (after quake.rc is loaded), on changing the <b>gamedir</b> alias 
<b>262_autoexec</b> is executed after ordinary configs loading. Thus, one can 
isolate specific part for QW262 config file, so that multiple error messages are 
not received under QW2.30 which does not understand QW262 scripting. </p>
<h3>Variables defined by user (cvar)</h3>
<table cellspacing=0 cellpadding=3 width="100%" border=0>
<tbody> 
<tr> 
<td valign=top noWrap><b>register cvar_name1 [cvar_name2...]</b></td>
<td valign=top>registers one or several variables for further use.</td>
</tr>
<tr> 
<td valign=top noWrap><b>unregister cvar_name1 [cvar_name2...]</b></td>
<td valign=top>kills unneeded variables. Built-in variables unfortunately can 
not be killed.</td>
</tr>
<tr> 
<td valign=top noWrap><b>cl_prefixchar</b></td>
<td valign=top>defines the symbol that has special meaning for cvar expansion, 
increment/decrement etc. Values <b>@</b> (default) and <b>$</b> (ZQuake compatibility 
mode) are allowed.</td>
</tr>
</tbody> 
</table>
<p>Values of variables (both built-in and defined by user) can be used in scripts. 
Sign <b>@</b> (or <b>$</b> if yo have changed <b>cl_prefixchar</b>) must stand 
before a name of such variable. Cvar expansion is not working for variables inside 
the dual quotation marks &quot;, with exception of the specially stipulated cases. 
</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<p><b>echo current fov: @fov<br>
register class style<br>
class medic<br>
style att<br>
bind t "say_team (@style-@class) Idu po kiwke"</b></p>
<p><i>One should remember one important thing. Script statement parsing and cvar 
expansion is made up to the end of line or semicolon symbol. So if you need to 
create a cvar containing semicolon you should create another variable, contatining 
it. For example:</i></p>
<p><b>set _tz &quot;;&quot;<br>
alias example &quot;set tmp a%a,%h@_tzlocation:%l'&quot;<br>
say_team @tmp</b></p>
<p>One can increase or decrease value of a variable in such way:<br>
<b>fov @+5</b> - increases fov by 5<br>
<b>fov @-5</b> - decreases fov by 5</p>
<p>There are some commands introduced to change values of variables:</p>
<table cellspacing=0 cellpadding=3 width="100%" border=0>

<tr> 
<td valign=top noWrap><b>set cvar_name value</b></td>
<td valign=top>assigns a new value to a variable.</td>

<b>&lt;pos&gt;</b> (each string starts at position 0) and of length <b>&lt;len&gt;</b> 
and then assign this piece to the <b>&lt;cvar&gt;</b> variable; <b>&lt;len&gt;</b> 
equals 1 if not defined. <br>
<b>set_calc &lt;cvar&gt; pos &lt;cvar2&gt; &lt;string&gt;</b> - search a <b>&lt;string&gt;</b>

<p>One can write multiline aliases. If the last character of the line is \ , then 
the next line is a continuation of that line. Don not forget that the maximum 
length of one interpreted line can not exceed 1024 charcters. </p>
<p>Sometimes it is necessary to use quotes inside quotes. For example when complex 
aliases create other aliases. Some variables are introduced to facilitate this 
process:</p>
<table cellspacing=0 cellpadding=3 width="100%" border=0>
<tbody> 
<tr> 
<td valign=top><b>cl_substsinglequote</b></td>
<td> 
<p>if not set to 0, all single quotation marks will be substituted by dual marks 
when alias is executed. Two single quotation marks in a row are substituted by 
one (if sustitution is permitted is permitted). Replacement of quotation marks 
takes place on execution of any command, if only a quotation mark is not located 
within the dual quotation marks. One should remember that during script parsing 
client accepts a string in double quotes as one parameter but removes these quotes. 
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr> 
<td><b>cl_stringescape</b></td>
<td>if not set to 0, a combination of \&quot; within the dual quotation marks 
is substituted by &quot; upon the command execution.</td>
</tr>
<tr> 
<td><b>cl_curlybraces</b></td>
<td>if not set to 0, symbols { and } can be used like \&quot;, and their nesting 
is correctly handled.</td>
</tr>
</tbody> 
</table>
<p>Examples:<br>
// automessage for a location of a flag drop:<br>
<b>cl_substsinglequote 1<br>
register v_flagdeath<br>
v_flagdeath "say_team ENEMY FLAG: %d; alias f_death"<br>
alias f_took "say_team I''ve got a flag!; alias f_death '@v_flagdeath'"<br>
<br>
cl_substsinglequote 0<br>
cl_stringescape 1<br>
alias f_took "say_team I've got a flag!; alias f_death \"say_team ENEMY FLAG: 
%d; alias f_death\"" <br>
</b></p>
<p>Note that both variants work slightly in different ways, so in the first case 
it is necessary to introduce one extra variable.</p>

<h3>Ocrana pak</h3>
<p>This pack modifies the font utilized in the console. Instead of 4 unused symbols 
with codes of 0x86-0x89, the bright, well noticeable &quot;lamps&quot; are used. 
They are handy to use for catching some very important game messages. However, 
it is not worthwhile to misuse them, the messages must be actually important to 
use them with &quot;lamps&quot;. </p>

<h2>loc-files support</h2>
<p>Loc-files are lists of special marks on a map created for a player to be able 
to automatically report his/her locations to teammates. Two types of the loc-files 
are supported: proxy (as those used by qizmo, NF-proxy, etc.) and QW262 own format. 
The files of QW262 format are located in the <b>loc</b> directory, while proxy 
format loc-files remain in the <b>locs</b> directory, so there should be no confusion 
:). Limits for a quantity of loc-points are removed for both types of loc-formats. 
</p>
<p>Advantages and backdrops of various loc-file types: </p>
<table cellspacing=0 cellpadding=3 width="100%" border=0>
<tbody> 
<tr> 
<td valign=top><b>proxy</b></td>
<td> 
<p>wide-spread format. Looks like a list of points with coordinates (x,y,z) and 
a message sent by %l flag. Since a point is selected by a minimum distance criteria, 
there is a so called &quot;point-behind-the-wall&quot; problem when a message 
does not really match your actual position. </p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr> 
<td valign=top><b>qw262</b></td>
<td>only QW262-supported. Represents a list of blocks-parallelepipeds :). The 
corresponding message is printed according to your presence in a definite block. 
Messages can be team-dependent, so that you can easily make messages like &quot;our 
FR&quot;, &quot;enemy FR&quot;. With the comparable degree of detail these locs 
have substantially smaller file-size, in comparison to that of proxy-locs. </td>

<h3>Loc creation</h3>
<p>The client has an ability to create loc-files (qw262 format only). Please note 
that currently there are two ways for setting message of loc-block: 1. using index 
in the &quot;msg&quot; table, 2. using direct &quot;name&quot; variant. Here are 
some commands to edit loc-files.</p>
<table cellspacing=0 cellpadding=3 width="100%" border=0>
<tbody> 
<tr> 
<td valign=top><b>mark point</b></td>
<td>Establishes one of the block apexes in the current position. If this already 
the second apex, then you are prompted for a message of this block. If you want 
to use an already utilized message, it is sufficient to input % and the number 
of this message. </td>

</tr>
<tr> 
<td valign=top><b>mark center [x y]</b></td>
<td>sets coordinates of a map center. When <b>x</b> and <b>y</b> are not defined, 
grabs your current position. You should use this command twice to mark two symmeric 
points and the center will be calculated automatically.</td>
</tr>
<tr> 
<td valign=top><b>loc_selectblock n</b></td>
<td>selects a block with number n. All coordinates and a message are printed in 
console. The block itself is highlighted in GL version. To cancel this selection 
use <b>loc_selectblock -1</b>. 
<p></p>
</td>
</tr>

<td noWrap><b>loc_selectnearestblock</b></td>
<td>selects a block nearest to the player's position.</td>
</tr>
<tr> 
<td valign=top noWrap><b>loc_editblock param [value]</b></td>
<td>If parameter equals to <b>x1, y1, z1, x2, y2 </b>or<b> z2</b>, the value is 
added to a corresponding coordinate of a selected block. When parameter is <b>msg1</b> 
or <b>msg2</b>, the value defines a number of a corresponding message. When parameter 
is <b>name</b>, then block message is set directly. If <b>value</b> is not set 
in command<b> </b>then it requested from console.</td>
</tr>
<tr> 
<td valign=top noWrap><b>loc_deleteblock [start [end]] </b></td>

</table>
<p>In short, a loc-file represents a sequence of special commands which upon loading 
of a map create appropriate data structures. Frankly speaking, loc-files of QW262 
format are simply executed by the <b>exec</b> command, so it is possible for player 
to put inside loc-files some other commands. </p>
<table cellspacing=0 cellpadding=3 width="100%" border=0>

<td>creates a block. First 6 parameters define coordinates of the block. Next 
four define numbers of messages printed for this block (for teams 0, 1, 2 and 
3). If parameters are not enough, the number of message of team 0 is utilized 
then. </td>
</tr>
<tr> 
<td valign=top noWrap><b>loc_point x1 y1 z1 x2 y2 z2 <br>

<tr> 
<td valign=top noWrap><b>loc_mirror (x|y|xy) [team1 team2]</b></td>
<td>automatically adds blocks by means of symmetrical mirror reflection of already 
existing blocks according to specified axes. Meanwhile, messages for teams 0 or 
1 (red or blue in TeamFortress) for mirrored blocks are conveniently exchanged. 
Note that the center of a map has to be previously defined by the <b>mark_center</b> 
command. In the case when block was created using the second variant of <b>loc_point</b> 
command, only blocks containing substring <b>@team1</b> are reflected and this 
substring is replaced by <b>@team2</b> for the reflected block.</td>
</tr>
<tr> 
<td valign=top noWrap><b>loc_granularity</b></td>
<td>set the detail level of loc-file (real coordinates are divided by this value, 
available range 1 - 64). Is set to 50 before loc-file loading is started for compatibility 
reasons. Required value should be set inside loc-file or in console before loc-file 
creation. . When <b>loc_granularity</b> is changed loc-file block and center coordinates 
are adjusted <b>mark save</b> command saves <b>loc_granularity</b> into loc file.</td>
</tr>
</tbody> 
</table>
<p>For symmetrical maps (such as most of TeamFortress maps, by the way) it is 
enough to mark a half (or even a quoter) of a map followed by duplicating it with 
the <b>loc_mirror</b> command. Example:<br>
<b>// keep2 :)<br>
mark center 0 0<br>
loc_point -61 44 2 -44 61 25 "@blue tower"<br>
loc_mirror xy blue red<br>
loc_mirror x blue yell <br>
loc_mirror y blue green</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>A cvar expansion is performed in loc-file messages. This should allow to construct 
more universal loc-files. For example it is possible to set <b>red, blue</b> variables 
to &quot;our&quot;, &quot;enemy&quot; or even to empty string to save message 
length. </p>

<h2>regexp triggers</h2>
<p>A new possibility is built-in to automatically carry out some actions (aliases) 
upon detecting a specific message in console or centerprint. </p>
<p><b>regexp</b> defines which messages (or whatever) will activate a trigger. 
The client uses the <a href="ftp://ftp.csx.cam.ac.uk/pub/software/programming/pcre/">PCRE</a> 
library (Perl-compatible regular expression library). You can find information 
how to write regexps in the PCRE's documentation.</p>
<p></p>
<p>A trigger is activated as soon as a string defined in this regexp is detected. 
At the same time a part of this string (which caused activation of a trigger) 
is put into a <b>@0</b> variable. Variable parts of regexp are put into <b>@1, 
@2 ... @9</b> variables. After that an alias (which name coinsides with the a 
name of the trigger) is executed. Tricky, huh? ;)</p>

<h2>QW262</h2>
<p>While playing on a QW262 server clients gain some extra abilities:</p>
<table cellspacing=0 cellpadding=3 width="100%" border=0>
<tbody> 
<tr> 
<td colspan=2><b>say_id (id | uid) text</b></td>
<td>send a message to the player with indicated <b>id</b> or <b>uid</b>.</td>

<tr> 
<td valign=top noWrap colspan=2><b>sayid text</b></td>

<tr> 
<td valign=top noWrap colspan=2><b>messagemode3</b></td>

</tr>
<tr> 
<td valign=top noWrap colspan=2><b>say_to_team team text</b></td>
<td>send a message to an indicated team. Handy on HUNTED or BORDER TF maps.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>

<p>Example:</p>
<p><b>uid lamer<br>
sayid "You are LAME!"<br>
// hunted<br>

<h3>What is different in QW262 lite server from standard qwsv 2.30</h3>
<p>QW262 server for Win32 automatically sets itself as a high priority task (HIGH_PRIORITY_CLASS). 
This is necessary for avoiding high PL when playing on localhost under Windows9x. 
If you desire to turn this feature off, launch the server with <b>-nopriority</b> 
command-line parameter. By the way, the reason for high ping (when QW2.30 server 
is running under Windows9x) was eliminated. Server uses 32 Megabytes of memory 
by default.</p>
<p>In order to reduce network traffic server performs <a href="#filter">message 
filtering</a>, according to <b>filter</b> variables set by players in userinfo. 
</p>
<p>Server includes support for TeamFortress flash grenade that can not be disabled 
by cheaters. If TeamFortress QuakeC code is modified accordingly then flashed 
client won't get entities updates from server, so players and other objects will 
dissapear for some time :)</p>
<p>Server has several catgories of <b>rcon</b>. Those who have ordinary <b>rcon_password</b> 
can not change several server settings (<b>serverinfo, localinfo, gamedir</b>), 
use <b>rcon say</b> and turn off <b>rcon logging</b>. Administrator password that 
allows to use any commands is set by <b>master_password</b> command. This command 
is accepted only from <b>server.cfg</b> </p>
<table cellspacing=0 cellpadding=3 width="100%" border=0>
<tbody> 
<tr> 
<td valign=top noWrap><b>sys_sleep</b></td>
<td>win32 version only. Time interval (in milliseconds) during which a server 
sleeps each tick allowing other programts to execute. It's better if you don't 
manipulate this parameter without full understanding of it :) (default 8 for Win9x 
and 0 for NT4/Win2000/WinXP).</td>

<h3>Server-side demos support (Multi View Demos: MVD)</h3>
<p>It is possible to write server-side demo. It contain all players actions. <i>Attention</i>: 
maximum number of entities tha coul be written into MVD demo is increased up to 
300 (QW Extended aka mvdsv - 196). Some TF-maps have a lot of entities and some 
of them simply are not recorded in the demo. If some demo really contain more 
than 196 entities, it will be played correctly only by QW262 client.</p>

<h3>Differences of the full version of server</h3>
<p>QW262 server in full version works on the changed protocol. Sources of the 
protocol are closed, so only a QW262 full version clients can connect to such 
server. All proxies with built-in cheats are also out of the game. By default 
the client is working on a QW 2.30 compatible protocol. To connect a QW262 full 
server one has to use a <b>version</b> command in the console or launch the client 
with a <b>-ver262</b> command line parameter.</p>
<p>QW262 full version server has an ability to check players' models and skins 
to prevent them from cheating. Clients with wrong models and skins are disconnected. 
Here are corresponding server commands:</p>
<table cellspacing=0 cellpadding=3 width="100%" border=0>
<tr> 
<td valign=top><b>allow_old_clients</b></td>
<td>when set to 1 (0 by default), allows protocol 2.30 connections to a 262full 
server.</td>
</tr>
<tbody> 
<tr> 
<td valign=top><b>addskin skin</b></td>
<td>adds a skin.pcx to the list of skins to check. Up to 20 different skins can 
be checked</td>
</tr>
<tr> 
<td valign=top noWrap><b>addmodel model</b></td>
<td>adds a model.mdl to the list of skins to check. Up to 20 different models 
can be checked</td>
</tr>
<tr> 
<td valign=top noWrap><b>removeskins</b></td>
<td> 
<p>cleans the list of skins to check.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr> 
<td valign=top noWrap><b>removemodels</b></td>
<td>cleans the list of models to check.</td>
</tr>
</tbody> 
</table>
<p>It is possible to automatically make a screenshot and download it from any 
client to check him for cheating.</p>
